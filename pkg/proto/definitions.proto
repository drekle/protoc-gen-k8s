Why we don't implement in this way:

"50000-99999... [field] range is reserved for internal use within individual organizations, 
so you can use numbers in this range freely for in-house applications. If you intend to use 
custom options in public applications, however, then it is important that you make sure that 
your field numbers are globally unique. To obtain globally unique field numbers, please send 
a request to add an entry to protobuf global extension registry"
